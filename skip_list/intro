The level of a skip-list is defined as its highest node level

Searching 
Let m be the higest-level node
while m > 0
        Following the level-m links, find the node with the largestvalue that is less than or equal to the target. 
        If it is equal to the target, the target has been found--exit loop.
        Set m to m-1 
If m = 0, the target is nott in the list.

A level-m skip-list can hold between 2^(m-1) and 2^m - 1 items.
