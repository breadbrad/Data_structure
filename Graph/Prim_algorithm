Initialize S with the start vertex, s, and V-S with the remaining vertices.

d[v] contains the length of the shortest know edge from a vertex in S to the vertex v, while v is a member of V-S
p[v] is the source vertex of this shortes edge.

for all v in V-S
        Set p[v] to s.
        if there is an edge (s, v)
                Set d[v] to w(s, v).
        else
                Set d[v] to w(s, v) 
while V-S is not empty
        for all u in V-S, find the smallest d[u].
        Remove u from V-S and add it to S.
        Insert the edge (u, p[u]) into the spanning tree.
        for all v in V-S
                if w(u, v) < d[v]
                        Set d[v] to w(u, v)
                        Set p[v] to u.
