Disk speed 
Disks are slow, with two different performance measures 
- Latency (seek time): how long to get your first bit of data
- Throughput (transfer rate): how quick once started
- Current latency : 5 ms
- Current throughput : migh get 1/2 MB in 5 ms
- For 5 ms, we get a few bytes of data
- For 10 ms, we get 1/2 MB
- Read disks in pages/blocks 

Organize data within the tree to corresspond to patge on disk
- Read one disk page (one tree node) at a time
- Maximum degree chosen depends on itmes being stored, disk characteristics
- If we read 1000 keys, but only look at 10, is that good?

Rules 
- Non-root: t-1 to 2t-1 keys
- Root: 1 to 2t-1 keys
- Non-leaves: one more children than keys
- Leaves: all at same level
