# Queue interface 
- Computation time 
# all operations -> O(1) 
# reallocation an array -> O(n) (amortized over n items, O(1) per item) 

- Storage requirements
# linked-list (single & double) implementations require more storage due to references 
# single -> 2 refs (data & link) , double -> 3 refs (data & 2 links) 
# double-linked list -> requires 1.5 times the storage of single-linked list 
# circular array -> requires the half size of single-linked list for storing same number of elements 
# if the array were reallocated, it would require the same storage as a single-linked list (half the array would be empty)
